 
Everything in javascript happens inside an execution context.

Assume this execution context as a big box or a container in which whole javascript code 
is executed.

Execution content has two component in it:


1. Memory Component: this is the place where all the variables and the functions

are stored as a key value pairs.
Note: Memory Component is also known as variable environment.


ex: key   :    value

     a    :      10
 
     fn   :     {----}




2. Code Component: This is the place where code is executed one line at a time.
Note: This is also known as thread of execution.

JavaScript is a synchronous single-threaded language.
